# The Spite License

A new license under which to release software, because god knows we don't have enough of [them](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) [already](https://xkcd.com/927/).

## What does it allow?

The Spite License is, in essence, a trapdoor — it allows potential licensees to use the software under the terms of the secondary license (as shown here, the standard MIT license) if and only if they do *not* read the license file itself.

## Why?

* Because it's funny
* Because you want randos on the Internet but not big companies with lawyers who make their engineers actually read licenses to use your software

Note, though, that I am not a lawyer and this was written as a joke — no legal professionals have read or approved of the Spite License and I make no claims as to its legality, enforceability, or efficacy in any jurisdiction.

## Colophon

I hereby abandon all rights and claims and release the text of the Spite License into the public domain.
